# Game-Automation
A simple yet powerful game automation script built using Python, leveraging OpenCV for computer vision and keyboard controls for simulating gameplay actions (right and left movements). Ideal for automating simple 2D games where object tracking and timed responses can boost performance or enable bot testing.
🚀 Features
🖥️ Screen capture using OpenCV

🎯 Object detection and tracking

⌨️ Simulated keypresses (left/right) for game input

⏱️ Timing-based logic for smooth gameplay automation

🔄 Loop-based automation for continuous play

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2) – For image processing and game screen analysis

time – For delays and execution timing

pyautogui / keyboard / pynput – For sending right/left key presses (depending on your preference)

📦 Installation

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/game-automation-python.git
cd game-automation-python
pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage
Launch your game and position the game window correctly.

Run the automation script:

python main.py
Watch the bot play using left and right arrow key inputs.

🧠 How It Works
Captures a region of the screen using OpenCV.

Processes frames to detect objects (like obstacles or the player).

Makes decisions to press left or right based on object position.

Uses time.sleep() to pace decisions based on gameplay speed.
